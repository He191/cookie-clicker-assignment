I fetched the data of API with useEffect method.
I created cookieUpgrade component then import that components to parent component App.jsx.
I created props to pass parameters to child from parent components.
I created setInterval to execute periodic tasks with the help of useEffect.
I used the .map() function to render lists of items dynamically.
I created buttons and applied event handler on it to incresed cookie count,add cookie count per second value.
